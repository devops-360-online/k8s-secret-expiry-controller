# k8s-secret-expiry-controller

A Kubernetes controller that watches for the expiration of Kubernetes Secrets and raises events accordingly.

## Description

This project is a Kubernetes Operator built with Kubebuilder. It introduces a new Custom Resource Definition (CRD) `SecretWithExpiry` into the Kubernetes API, which is like a regular Secret but with an added expiry date.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Installing the CRDs into the Cluster

Install the CRDs into a cluster:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/devops-360-online/k8s-secret-expiry-controller.git
cd k8s-secret-expiry-controller
kubectl apply -k config/crd
kubectl apply -k config/default
```

## Build and push your image to the location specified by IMG

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/k8s-secret-expiry-controller:tag
```

## Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by IMG

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/default
```

## Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

## Undeploy Controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions. Please feel free to submit pull requests for bug fixes, improvements or new features.

## How It Works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes Operator pattern. It uses Controllers, which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

## Test It Out

Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

NOTE: You can also run this in one step by running: make install run

## Modifying the API Definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

NOTE: Run `make --help` for more information on all potential make targets.
